The original source of Glide is imported from here: https://github.com/bumptech/glide

We import only these modules:
    * third_party/glide/annotation
    * third_party/glide/disklrucache
    * third_party/glide/library

The Glide module provides a image loading/caching library, which we import in code base in order to
solve bugs. We make some change in order to deploy with our continuous integration system:
    1. Remove GIF support.
    2. Remove testing code.
