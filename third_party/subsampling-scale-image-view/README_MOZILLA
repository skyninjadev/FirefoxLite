The original source of subsampling-scale-image-view is imported from here: https://github.com/davemorrissey/subsampling-scale-image-view

This module provides a large image display/decode/gesture android view widget, which we import the
source code into our codebase in order to solve bugs. We only import the java files for the library
without the sample app.
